        <p>First, I&rsquo;d like to wish everyone a Happy New Year!  One of my goals this year is to post something new here weekly.  I&rsquo;ve been back and forth with different editors over the past couple years, but always seem to keep coming back to Vim.  So, this year, I want to challenge myself to learn something new &ndash; keep improving so I can become much more proficient with Vim.</p>

<p>To kick things off this new year, I want to share how I&rsquo;ve recently re-configured my machine and set up tmux for remote pairing.</p>

<p>Over the past several years, I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure to pair with a friend of mine, Michael Joseph Kramer, who I feel is a pretty advanced Vim user. He has taught me many keybindings and shortcuts that I still use to this day.  In fact, I use most of his Vim configs, with several small tweaks.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not already doing so, I suggest keeping your configuration files up on Github.  It&rsquo;s especially nice once you get a new computer to instantly go back to all of the things you know quickly.</p>

<p>You can find my settings <a href="http://github.com/andrewvida/Config">here</a>.  Be sure to take a look at the Rakefile as to how files get symlinked, plugins get installed and several other cool tricks!</p>

<p>Also be sure to take a look at the &lsquo;.vim&rsquo; directory.  There you will see how what plugins I run, as well as special keybindings and other goodness.  I feel that this is broken down very well.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for other Vim config examples, I suggest that you take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/neo/vim-config">Neo vim-config</a> and <a href="https://github.com/chrishunt/dot-files">Chris Hunt&rsquo;s dot-files</a>.</p>

<p>Next up is tmux.  If you&rsquo;ve never worked with tmux before, you&rsquo;re in for a treat!  tmux is a terminal multiplexer.  It enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen.  A killer feature of tmux is that you can detach from a screen and it continues to run in the background until you come back to it.  I&rsquo;ll touch on this a bit later.  tmux is also excellent for remote pairing.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how I set up my machine for remote pairing:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tmuxinator/tmuxinator">tmuxinator</a> - Allows easy creation and management of tmux sessions.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/chrishunt/github-auth">github-auth</a> - Easily pair with anyone with a GitHub account by adding their public ssh keys to your authorized_keys file.</li>
</ul>


<p>In my Config project, you&rsquo;ll see the &lsquo;.tmux.conf&rsquo; file with special bindings.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re new to tmux in general, be sure to pick up <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/bhtmux/tmux">tmux Productive Mouse-Free Development</a> by Brian P. Hogan.</p>

<p>Enjoy learning about all of the things you can do with vim and tmux!  You&rsquo;re going to have a great time!  If you still don&rsquo;t believe me, check this out: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jzWDr24UHQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jzWDr24UHQ</a></p>
