        <p>This quick tip comes from my fellow Double Agent, Ryan Castillo (@rmcastil).  Thanks Ryan!</p>

<p>When working in Vim, I typically have two vertical splits going.  One for tests and the other for the code under test.  If I decide to disconnect from my cinema display, then the splits need to be resized to work on my MacBook screen.</p>

<p>My typical workflow was to use <code>:vertical resize</code> and keep incrementing until the splits look about the same size.</p>

<p>One afternoon, Ryan and I were pairing and as he was watching my play around with my splits, he suggested this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-vim" data-lang="vim">ctrl<span class="p">-</span><span class="k">w</span> <span class="p">=</span></code></pre></div>


<p>Splits within the window are now equally sized!</p>
